This is an ASP.NET Core 2 project. Its main porpose is to create an application, which can help me to generate randomly names and surnames for English and German NPCs (or their fantasy equivalents). The existing namegenerators I could find couldn't provide me a reasonable randomization of first and last names, so I wrote mine. 

Now the NameGen is capable of generating random English and German names. The lists of first names primarily were taken from Kurufin.ru, and the lists of last names were taken from across the Internet.
